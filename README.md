# Dotfiles

## Setup
#### Installing & using

* Read and run parts of `setup-a-new-machine.sh`
* Read and run `symlink-setup.sh`
  * git config needs attention, read the notes.
* Use it. yay!

#### Maintenance

* Commit/push changes you want.
* You can also hypothetically cherry-pick commits from me and mathias and our fork ecosystem.

#### Shell

This repo contains config for bash, zsh, and fish. As of March 2016, I'm using fish shell mostly, but fall back to bash once in a while. The bash and fish stuff are both well maintained; zsh, less so. If you're using fish you'll want to do a `git submodule update --init`.


## My favorite parts.

### [`.aliases`](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases) and [`.functions`](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions)

### The "readline config" (`.inputrc`)
Basically it makes typing into the prompt amazing.

* Tab like crazy for autocompletion that doesnt suck. tab all the things. srsly.
* No more <tab><tab> that says "Display all 1745 possibilities? (y or n)" YAY
* Type `cat <uparrow>` to see your previous `cat`s and use them.
* Case insensitivity.
* Tab all the livelong day.


### Moving around in folders (`z`, `...`, `cdf`)
`z` helps you jump around to whatever folder. It uses actual real magic to determine where you should jump to. Seperately there's some `...` aliases to shorten `cd ../..` and `..`, `....` etc. Then, if you have a folder open in Finder, `cdf` will bring you to it.
```sh
z dotfiles
z blog
....      # drop back equivalent to cd ../../..
z public
cdf       # cd to whatever's up in Finder
```
`z` learns only once its installed so you'll have to cd around for a bit to get it taught.
Lastly, I use `open .` to open Finder from this path. (That's just available normally.)

### `.extra` for your private configuration

There will be items that don't belong to be committed to a git repo, because either 1) it shoudn't be the same across your machines or 2) it shouldn't be in a git repo. Kick it off like this:

`touch ~/.extra && $EDITOR $_`

I have some EXPORTS, my PATH construction, and a few aliases for ssh'ing into my servers in there.

I don't know how other folks manage their $PATH, but this is how I do mine:

```shell
# The top-most paths override here.
      PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly
# ...

export PATH
```

### `~/bin`

One-off binaries that aren't via an npm global or homebrew. [git open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open), [wifi-password](https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password), [coloredlogcat](https://developer.sinnerschrader-mobile.com/colored-logcat-reloaded/507/), [git-overwritten](https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-overwritten), and `subl` for Sublime Text.
